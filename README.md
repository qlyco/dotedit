## Overview

DotEditor is a simple pixel art editor designed as an alternative to Microsoft Paint.
The editor is designed to be simple and easy to use for creating pixel art.
This editor is a free complementary software for DotSweeper, our new puzzle game
that combines aspects of picross/nonogram with minesweeper, inspired by an old
Gameboy Advance game called Hatena Satena, which is never released outside of Japan.

The image exported by this editor is a regular bitmap file compatible with any
existing image viewer. However, we added some extra data that allows any images
created with this editor to act as a playable level in DotSweeper.
